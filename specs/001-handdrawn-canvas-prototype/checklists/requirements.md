# Specification Quality Checklist: Handdrawn Canvas Prototype

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality - PASS
- Specification focuses on "what" and "why" without prescribing "how"
- Technical constraints are listed separately as requirements, not as implementation guidance
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001 specifies exact position coordinates)
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (e.g., "3 out of 5 team members", "60fps", "500ms")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on user outcomes and performance characteristics)
- Three prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases identified with reasonable fallback behaviors documented
- Scope is clearly bounded with explicit "Out of Scope" section
- Assumptions (A-001 through A-008) and Dependencies sections present

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- All 15 functional requirements map to acceptance criteria in user stories
- User stories cover the primary validation flow (P1: design validation, P2: accessibility, P3: performance)
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-007 provide measurable validation metrics
- No implementation leakage - technical details are constraints, not prescriptive implementation

### Issues Found
None - specification is ready for planning phase.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: âœ… APPROVED FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.

All checklist items pass validation. The specification:
- Clearly defines the prototype's purpose (UI/UX validation)
- Provides measurable success criteria for validation
- Lists all functional requirements without implementation details
- Identifies reasonable assumptions and constraints
- Scopes the feature appropriately for a proof-of-concept prototype

No blocking issues identified. Recommended next step: `/speckit.plan`

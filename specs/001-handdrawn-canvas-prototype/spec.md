# Feature Specification: Handdrawn Canvas Prototype

**Feature Branch**: `001-handdrawn-canvas-prototype`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "목표: 캔버스에 손그림 도형 1개를 렌더링하고 손글씨 텍스트를 표시하여 Knotly의 UI/UX 방향성을 검증한다. rough.js와 나눔손글씨 펜 폰트를 조합하여 기존 마인드맵 도구와 차별화되는 따뜻하고 친근한 인터페이스를 구현한다."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Visual Design Validation (Priority: P1)

As a product team member, I need to view a prototype canvas that demonstrates Knotly's unique hand-drawn aesthetic, so that I can validate whether our UI/UX direction differentiates us from existing mindmap tools and resonates with our target users.

**Why this priority**: This is the core purpose of the entire feature - to validate the UI/UX direction. Without this, we cannot proceed with confidence in our design decisions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the application in a browser and visually confirming that a single hand-drawn circle node with handwritten text appears in the center of the canvas. Team members can assess whether it feels "warm", "friendly", and "hand-drawn" compared to traditional mindmap tools.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running on localhost:5173, **When** I open the page in a browser, **Then** I see a canvas with a light gray background (#fafafa) displaying a single yellow circle node in the center
2. **Given** I am viewing the canvas, **When** I look at the circle node, **Then** I can see visible hand-drawn imperfections (slight trembling lines) that distinguish it from perfect geometric shapes
3. **Given** I am viewing the node, **When** I read the text inside, **Then** I see "손글씨 노트 프로토타입" rendered in Nanum Pen Script font with clear, legible handwritten styling
4. **Given** I am viewing the prototype, **When** I compare it mentally to tools like MindMeister or Miro, **Then** I can identify distinct visual differences that convey warmth and approachability

### User Story 2 - Visual Accessibility Verification (Priority: P2)

As a product team member, I need to verify that the hand-drawn text is readable and meets accessibility standards, so that I can ensure our design direction doesn't compromise usability.

**Why this priority**: Accessibility is critical but secondary to validating the core visual direction. Once we confirm the design feels right, we need to ensure it's actually usable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested using browser developer tools to check color contrast ratios and by zooming in/out to verify text clarity at different scales.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing the node, **When** I check the color contrast between text (#333) and background (#FFE082), **Then** the contrast ratio is at least 4.5:1 for accessibility compliance
2. **Given** I am viewing the canvas, **When** I zoom in or out using browser controls (Ctrl+scroll), **Then** the text and shapes remain sharp and clear without pixelation
3. **Given** I am viewing the text, **When** I read "손글씨 노트 프로토타입" at default zoom, **Then** the 18px font size with 1.5 line spacing is comfortably readable

### User Story 3 - Performance Validation (Priority: P3)

As a product team member, I need to confirm that the rendering performs smoothly, so that I can validate this approach won't cause performance issues as we scale.

**Why this priority**: Performance is important but not a blocker for initial design validation. A slightly slow prototype is acceptable for validation purposes.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested using browser DevTools Performance tab to measure rendering frame rate and using Network tab to measure font loading time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** I open DevTools Performance tab and record while viewing the canvas, **Then** the frame rate maintains 60fps consistently
2. **Given** I load the page with Network tab open, **When** the Nanum Pen Script font loads, **Then** it completes within 500ms and displays without FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text)
3. **Given** I load the page, **When** measuring from navigation start to first meaningful paint, **Then** the total load time is under 1 second

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the browser window is resized? (Node position should remain centered)
- How does the rendering appear on different display pixel densities (Retina vs standard)? (SVG should scale cleanly)
- What happens if the Nanum Pen Script font fails to load from Google Fonts? (Should fall back to system sans-serif with display:swap)
- What happens if the browser doesn't support SVG? (Should show degraded but functional view - though this is rare in modern browsers)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST render a single circular node at canvas center position (x: 400, y: 300)
- **FR-002**: System MUST draw the circle using hand-drawn styling with visible imperfections (roughness parameter set to 1.2)
- **FR-003**: System MUST fill the circle with yellow background color (#FFE082)
- **FR-004**: System MUST draw the circle outline in black (#000) with 2px stroke width
- **FR-005**: System MUST display the text "손글씨 노트 프로토타입" inside the circle node
- **FR-006**: System MUST render text using Nanum Pen Script font at 18px size
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply 1.5 line spacing to the text
- **FR-008**: System MUST render text in dark gray color (#333)
- **FR-009**: System MUST render all graphics using SVG format for resolution independence
- **FR-010**: System MUST display canvas with light gray background (#fafafa)
- **FR-011**: System MUST load Nanum Pen Script font from Google Fonts with preconnect and display:swap optimization
- **FR-012**: System MUST use solid fill style for the circle (not hatched or crosshatched)
- **FR-013**: System MUST NOT include any interactive features (no click, drag, or edit functionality)
- **FR-014**: System MUST NOT render any connection lines, grid backgrounds, or additional nodes
- **FR-015**: System MUST use hardcoded node data (no backend integration)

### Key Entities

- **Node**: Represents a single visual element on the canvas with properties including:
  - Unique identifier (id: "node-1")
  - Position coordinates (x, y pixel values)
  - Content text (string)
  - Shape type (currently only "circle" supported)
  - Visual styling (backgroundColor, strokeColor, strokeWidth)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: When team members view the prototype, at least 3 out of 5 provide feedback using terms like "warm", "friendly", or "hand-drawn feeling"
- **SC-002**: When team members compare this prototype to existing mindmap tools, at least 4 out of 5 report that it feels "different from existing tools"
- **SC-003**: Page loads and displays the node within 1 second of navigation
- **SC-004**: Browser maintains 60fps rendering performance when viewing the canvas
- **SC-005**: Font loads and displays within 500ms without visible text style changes
- **SC-006**: Text color and background color contrast ratio measures at 4.5:1 or higher
- **SC-007**: Visual appearance remains sharp and clear when zoomed between 50% and 200% browser zoom levels

## Assumptions

- **A-001**: React 18 + TypeScript development environment with Vite build tool is already initialized
- **A-002**: Development server runs on default Vite port (5173)
- **A-003**: Target browsers support modern web standards (SVG, CSS web fonts, ES modules)
- **A-004**: Google Fonts service is accessible and reliable for loading Nanum Pen Script
- **A-005**: Team members have basic understanding of mindmap/note-taking tools for comparison
- **A-006**: This is an early-stage prototype intended solely for design validation, not production use
- **A-007**: The canvas viewport is sized appropriately for position (400, 300) to be visually centered
- **A-008**: Korean language text rendering is properly supported in target browsers

## Dependencies

None - this is a standalone prototype feature with no dependencies on other features or systems.

## Constraints & Limitations

### Functional Constraints
- No user interaction: The node is purely static and non-interactive
- Single shape type: Only circular nodes are supported (no rectangles, clouds, or other shapes)
- Single node: Exactly one node is rendered (not zero, not multiple)
- No connections: Connection lines between nodes are not supported
- No background patterns: Only solid color backgrounds (no grids or textures)
- Hardcoded data: All node data is embedded in frontend code, no dynamic loading

### Technical Constraints
- Must use React 18 with TypeScript
- Must use Vite as build tool
- Must use rough.js library for hand-drawn effects

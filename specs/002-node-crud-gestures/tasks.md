**Checkpoint**: User Story 4 complete. Users can long-press nodes to open context menu, change colors, delete nodes. Verify cascade delete of edges works correctly.

---

## Phase 8: User Story 7 - Visual Grid and Alignment (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Provide structured appearance through grid display and alignment for users who value order.

**Independent Test**: Toggle grid display on/off in settings, verify gray lines appear/disappear. Enable grid snap and drag nodes to verify automatic alignment to 20px intersections.

**Week 2**:
- Developer A: Phase 6 (US6 - Navigation)
- Developer B: Phase 7 (US4 - Colors/Delete)
- Developer C: Phase 8 (US7 - Grid Polish)

**Week 3**:
- Developer A: Phase 9 (US5 - @Mentions)
- Developer B+C: Phase 10 (Polish) - can split verification tasks

**Total**: ~3 weeks with 3 developers vs ~6-8 weeks with 1 developer

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- No automated tests requested - use manual testing via acceptance scenarios
- Commit after each task or logical group (e.g., T020+T021 together for US1 components)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- Performance critical: verify 60fps, <100ms response times throughout
- Gesture conflict resolution is critical - test pinch vs pan thresholds carefully per clarification Q5
- Cascade delete (FR-012) must be tested thoroughly in US4 to prevent orphaned edges

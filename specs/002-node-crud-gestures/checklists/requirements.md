# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive Graph Editor with Touch Gestures

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… **PASS - Ready for Planning**

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase.

### Key Strengths

1. **Comprehensive User Stories**: 7 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) with clear independent test criteria
2. **Detailed Acceptance Scenarios**: Each story has 3 specific Given/When/Then scenarios
3. **Measurable Success Criteria**: 15 specific, technology-agnostic metrics with quantifiable targets
4. **Well-Defined Scope**: Clear boundaries between in-scope and out-of-scope features
5. **Thorough Edge Cases**: 9 edge cases identified covering common boundary conditions
6. **Complete Entity Model**: 5 key entities (Node, Link, Canvas, Context Menu, @Mention Panel) clearly defined
7. **Explicit Assumptions**: 12 assumptions documented covering technical and UX constraints
8. **Clear Dependencies**: 4 dependencies identified from Milestone 1

### Notes

- Specification successfully avoids implementation details while remaining precise
- All requirements are independently testable
- Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes rather than internal metrics
- Scope boundaries are explicitly stated to prevent scope creep
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning

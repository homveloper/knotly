# Specification Quality Checklist: Markdown File-Based Mind Map with Token System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Initial Validation Results**:
- 2 clarification items identified and resolved
- All checklist items now **PASS**

**Clarifications Resolved** (2025-10-19):

1. **Duplicate Node IDs** → **Decision: Silent auto-correction**
   - Auto-generates new unique ID for duplicate nodes
   - Logs warning to console.warn() only
   - No user-facing notification

2. **Large File Size Limit** → **Decision: No hard limit**
   - Shows performance warning for large files (10,000+ nodes)
   - Allows user to proceed without blocking
   - Respects user choice even for very large files

**Final Status**: ✅ Specification is complete, validated, and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

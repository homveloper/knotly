# Specification Quality Checklist: Markdown Mind Map Editor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The specification is written in business language focusing on user capabilities and outcomes. No mention of React, TypeScript, Zustand, or other implementation technologies. All technical details are deferred to the planning phase.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-020) are testable and unambiguous. For example:
- FR-001 specifies "300ms debounce" - measurable and testable
- FR-012 specifies "30%-70% range" - clear bounds
- FR-016 specifies exact HTML comment format - unambiguous

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: "within 300ms" - quantitative metric
- SC-003: "100% of standard markdown elements" - measurable completeness
- SC-007: "byte-for-byte identical" - verifiable without implementation knowledge

✅ **PASS** - All five user stories have comprehensive acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format. Edge cases cover syntax errors, race conditions, performance boundaries, and data integrity scenarios.

✅ **PASS** - Scope is bounded through 10 explicit assumptions (e.g., Assumption 3 excludes real-time collaboration, Assumption 10 excludes auto-save). Dependencies identified in Assumptions section.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Each of the 20 functional requirements maps to one or more acceptance scenarios in the user stories. For example:
- FR-007 (prevent circular updates) → User Story 1, Scenario 5 + Edge Case
- FR-014 (layout toggle buttons) → User Story 5, Scenarios 1-2

✅ **PASS** - Five user stories are prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable. P1 (bidirectional sync) is the MVP core. Each story can be demonstrated standalone.

✅ **PASS** - All nine success criteria are measurable outcomes from user/business perspective:
- SC-002: "under 100ms without cursor position jumping" - user experience metric
- SC-005: "within 1 second for documents with up to 100 nodes" - performance metric
- SC-009: "gracefully" with specific examples - qualitative with quantitative bounds

## Notes

- ✅ All checklist items passed validation
- ✅ Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- ✅ No clarifications needed - all requirements are unambiguous with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section

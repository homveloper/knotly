# Knotly Constitution

## Core Development Principles

### I. Error Handling (Error as Value)

**Rule**: NEVER use throw or exception for error handling. Always use error as value pattern.

**Requirements**:
- Return Result types that explicitly represent success or failure states
- Functions MUST return objects containing either the successful value or error information
- Callers MUST handle errors explicitly without try-catch blocks
- All error states MUST be represented in the return type signature

**Rationale**: Exception-based error handling creates invisible control flow paths that make code harder to reason about and test. Error as value makes all failure modes explicit in function signatures, forcing callers to handle errors at compile time rather than runtime. This approach aligns with functional programming principles and improves code reliability.

### II. Object Composition (Composition over Inheritance)

**Rule**: NEVER use inheritance or is-a relationships. Always prefer composition and has-a relationships.

**Requirements**:
- Build complex objects by composing simpler objects together
- Avoid creating class hierarchies
- Use interfaces for contracts, composition for implementation
- Favor object aggregation and delegation patterns

**Rationale**: Inheritance creates tight coupling and fragile base class problems. Composition provides flexibility, easier testing through dependency injection, and clearer separation of concerns. This makes code more maintainable and adaptable to changing requirements.

### III. Dependency Injection (Explicit Dependencies)

**Rule**: Always use explicit dependency injection. All dependencies MUST be passed in as constructor parameters or function arguments.

**Requirements**:
- NEVER create dependencies inside a class or function
- All dependencies MUST be visible in constructor/function signatures
- Dependencies MUST be testable and replaceable
- Use dependency injection containers only when necessary for large applications

**Rationale**: Explicit dependencies make code testable, as dependencies can be mocked or stubbed. It also makes dependencies immediately visible when reading code, improving maintainability. Hidden dependencies (created internally) make testing difficult and create tight coupling.

### IV. Object Creation (Factory Functions)

**Rule**: NEVER use constructors for object creation. Always use static factory functions or creation functions instead.

**Requirements**:
- Constructors MUST NOT be used for object instantiation
- Use static factory methods (e.g., `User.create()`) or standalone factory functions
- Factory functions MUST validate inputs before creating objects
- Factory functions MUST return Result types to handle validation errors
- All created objects MUST be in valid states

**Rationale**: Constructors cannot return errors or perform validation properly because they must return an instance or throw an exception. Factory functions can validate inputs and return error values using the Error as Value pattern (Principle I), ensuring all created objects are valid and eliminating the need for post-construction validation.

### V. Code Quality Standards

**Rule**: Maintain high code quality standards across the entire codebase.

**Requirements**:
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use TypeScript strict mode to catch type errors at compile time
- Follow domain-driven design patterns to keep business logic isolated from infrastructure concerns
- Prefer immutability and pure functions that do not cause side effects
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Use meaningful variable and function names that express intent
- Document complex logic with clear comments explaining WHY, not WHAT

**Rationale**: High code quality reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and makes onboarding new developers easier. TypeScript strict mode catches type errors early. DDD patterns create clear boundaries between business logic and technical concerns. Immutability and pure functions make code predictable and testable.

### VI. Testing Standards

**Rule**: Follow rigorous testing standards with comprehensive test coverage.

**Requirements**:
- Write unit tests for all domain logic with at least 80 percent test coverage
- Use the test pyramid approach: 60 percent unit tests, 30 percent integration tests, 10 percent end-to-end tests
- Structure tests using Given-When-Then pattern for clarity
- Run all tests in CI/CD pipeline before merging code
- Tests MUST be deterministic and independent of execution order
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Use contract tests for API boundaries

**Rationale**: Comprehensive testing catches bugs early and provides confidence when refactoring. The test pyramid balances speed (fast unit tests) with confidence (slower E2E tests). Given-When-Then makes tests readable as specifications. CI/CD integration prevents regressions from reaching production.

### VII. User Experience Consistency

**Rule**: Ensure user experience consistency across all devices and accessibility standards.

**Requirements**:
- Design mobile-first with touch-optimized interfaces
- Support keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards for color contrast and screen reader compatibility
- Maintain 60fps rendering performance for smooth animations and interactions
- Test on actual mobile devices, not just desktop browsers
- Provide visual feedback for all user actions within 100ms
- Support both light and dark themes where applicable

**Rationale**: Mobile-first design ensures the experience works on constrained devices. Keyboard navigation and WCAG compliance make the application accessible to users with disabilities. 60fps rendering provides a professional, responsive feel. Testing on real devices catches issues that desktop emulators miss.

### VIII. Performance Requirements

**Rule**: Meet strict performance requirements to ensure smooth user experience.

**Requirements**:
- Frontend MUST render 100 nodes at 60fps without frame drops
- API responses MUST have p95 latency under 200ms
- Database queries MUST use proper indexes and connection pooling
- Keep memory usage under 50MB on mobile devices
- Use debouncing, memoization, and virtualization to optimize expensive operations
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources
- Monitor performance metrics in production

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction and retention. 60fps is the threshold for smooth animations that users perceive as responsive. 200ms API latency keeps interactions feeling instant. Memory constraints on mobile devices require careful resource management. Performance monitoring catches regressions before they impact users.

## Quality Standards

### Code Review Requirements

All code changes MUST be reviewed by at least one other developer before merging. Reviews MUST verify:
- Compliance with all Core Development Principles
- Test coverage meets 80 percent minimum
- Performance requirements are satisfied
- Accessibility standards are met
- Documentation is clear and complete

### Continuous Integration Gates

CI pipeline MUST enforce the following gates before allowing merges:
- All unit tests pass
- Integration tests pass
- E2E critical path tests pass
- TypeScript compilation succeeds with strict mode
- Linting passes with no warnings
- Test coverage is at least 80 percent
- No security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Documentation Requirements

All features MUST include:
- User-facing documentation in `docs/` explaining functionality
- API documentation for all public interfaces
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant design choices
- Inline code comments for complex algorithms or business logic

## Governance

### Amendment Process

This constitution can be amended through the following process:
1. Propose amendment in a GitHub issue with rationale
2. Discussion period of at least 3 days
3. Approval from project maintainers
4. Update constitution with version bump following semantic versioning
5. Update all dependent templates and documentation
6. Create migration plan if existing code needs updates

### Version Semantics

Constitution version follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions
- **MINOR**: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

All pull requests MUST include a compliance checklist verifying adherence to this constitution. Maintainers MAY request justification for any principle violations. Violations MUST be documented in the Complexity Tracking section of the implementation plan with:
- Which principle is violated
- Why the violation is necessary
- What simpler alternative was rejected and why

### Enforcement

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. In case of conflict between this document and other guidance, this constitution takes precedence. Developers are expected to raise concerns about principle violations during code review.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-17 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-17
